## Overview

Supabase Storage is used to manage and store user-uploaded files such as profile pictures, background images, and other media. This allows users to customize their profiles and share content seamlessly.

## File Structure

## Usage

1. **Uploading Files**: Users can upload files through the profile edit page. Ensure that the file types are supported (e.g., .jpg, .png, .mp3).
2. **Accessing Files**: Uploaded files can be accessed via public URLs generated by Supabase Storage.
3. **Managing Files**: Users can delete or replace their uploaded files through the profile management interface.

## Configuration
